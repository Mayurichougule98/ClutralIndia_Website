<font color="white"  face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">
<p>When it comes to food, Kerala is indeed rich with its numerous authentic delicacies. Kerala, the land of coconut trees, is famous for its delicious dishes that use coconut oil, coconut milk and grated coconut in abundance. It is this addition of coconut products and special spices that enhances the taste and aroma of Kerala food, making it stand out from other Indian dishes.

Keralites prepare a good variety of both vegetarian and non vegetarian food. The southern part of Kerala is well known for scrumptious sea food delicacies, while the northern part of the state specializes in other non-vegetarian dishes.</p>

<li><h3>Kappa:</li></h3>
<p>Tapioca, known locally as Kappa, is a staple diet for Malayalees. It is as tasty as it is healthy, and a lot of foreign tourists prefer to indulge in kappa, especially during their house boat trips.
Though numerous kappa preparations are available, you will enjoy the mashed kappa the most. Mashed kappa paired with Kerala fish curry is a mouthwatering dish that you must try. This easy to cook food can be consumed as a starter, breakfast, side dish for your lunch, or as an any-time snack. It can also be eaten with a variety of curries and chutneys.</p>

<h3><li>Kallummakaya</li></h3>

<p>Now, let’s have a taste of a delicious non vegetarian food, courtesy of the Malabar regions of Kerala. Though kallummakaya or mussels is not very common in other parts of Kerala, almost all Keralites have enjoyed this auspicious dish.

Roasted kallummakaya with rice filling is the tastiest preparation of them all. It is a traditional Thalassery dish, which is unavoidable at parties and special functions. Kallummakaya is also used to make other tasty dishes like kallummakaya fry, kallummakaya curry and kallummakaya biriyani.</p>

<h3><li>Sadya:</h3></li>

<p>If you are searching for a heavy lunch, the sadya is the that aptly suits your appetite. It is an elaborate dish with rice and a lot of curries, accompanied by sweet payasam. In a normal sadya you will get 5 to 8 curries, but you will be served much more in the larger functions.

Sadya is traditionally served on a banana leaf. The position of the leaf and the placement of the curries have to follow a specific order. The way the banana leaf is folded after lunch is also significant for this traditional food. The sadya is a complete vegetarian dish which is usually served during festivals and special functions.</p>

<h3><li>Avial</h3></li>
<p>Among the numerous curries in sadya, one outstanding curry is avial. It is indeed a rich preparation with lots of vegetables and coconut. The vegetables are sliced into thin pieces and cooked to a crunchy consistency with lightly beaten curd, garlic, coconut grinding and coconut oil. The malty colored vegetables adds a visual beauty to the curry. The addition of vegetables also makes it a healthy dish.</p>

<h3><li>Kerala Biriyani</h3></li>

<p>Biriyani is an all time favorite food in India. But the biriyani preparation differs from place to place, and hence the name also changes according to the place and the ingredients used in it. Biriyani is usually a mixture of rice, spices, meat or vegetables.
The selection of the rice and the proportion of ingredients are both very important in biriyani preparation. The most attractive quality of a biriyani is its aroma. Malabar biriyani is the tastiest variety of Kerala biriyani, and the choice of khaima rice makes it quite unique. Biriyani is a common food in Kerala, especially for functions and special days.</p>

<h3><li>Kerala Fish Curry</h3></li>

<p>The red colored fish curry with kudampuli or fish tamarind is a compulsory dish for almost all Keralites. Fish tamarind is the souring agent and it also adds to the taste of the fish curry. Fenugreek, green chilly, red chilly powder, turmeric and curry leaves are the other taste makers.
Kerala fish curry is a very healthy dish and it is also an apt food for the Kerala climate. Normally fish curry is prepared in clay pots to make it more delicious and durable. If the proportion of ingredients are correct, the curry can be stored for many days.</p>
