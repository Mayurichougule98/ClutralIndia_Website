<h3><li>Narali Pournima:</li></h3>
<p>The full moon day of the month of Shravan is celebrated in different parts of Maharashtra and is known variously as Narali Pournima, Shravani Pournima, Rakhi Pournima or Raksha Bandhan. 'Naral' means 'coconut', and Narali Pournmia is thus called because offerings of coconuts are made by people to the sea-god on this day.

Another fun-filled ritual performed on this day is dahi-handi - clay pots filled with curd, puffed rice and milk are strung high up above the streets and groups of enthusiastic young men (and even women) form human pyramids to reach these and break them open, the way Lord Krishna and his friends would, after sneaking into the houses of gopis (milkmaids) to steal and eat butter.</p>

<h3><li>Ganesh Chaturthi:</li></h3>

People decorate the entrances of their homes with torans, marigold flower studded strings, and worship the tools of trade, vehicles, machinery, weapons and books. As the evening falls, the villagers cross the border, a ritual known as Simollanghan, and worship the Shami tree. The leaves of the Apta tree are collected and exchanged among friends and relatives as gold.</p>
 
<h3><li>Holi/Vasant Panchami:</li></h3>
<p>Holi/Vasant Panchami each year, after a successful winter harvest, people get ready to welcome the spring with Holi - the festival of colours.

On the next day, people of all ages come outside and play with each other with coloured water. Brightly coloured powders are applied on faces, and there is plenty of music, dance and sweets to fill the rest of the day.</p>
