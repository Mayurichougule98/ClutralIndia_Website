<h2>Gujrat Food</h2>
<ul type="disk">
<li><h3>Dhokla:</li></h3>
<p>Inarguably, Dhokla symbolizes a Gujarati and people here are frequently considered to be a Dhokla lover. Dhokla, made of fermented rice and split chickpeas, can be segregated in various sizes, colour and the varied style of fried and boiled ones, often served with Green Chutney/ Meethi Chutney made of Khajoor (Dates) and Aamli(Tamarind). These soft, sweet- namkeen tasted, often fried with mustard, cumin seeds,  curry leaves (Indian Lilac), relish the taste-buds.</p>
 
<li><h3> Handva:</li></h3>
<p>Be it a breakfast, lunch or dinner, a Gujju would never deny the Handva offered to him/her. Handva, a member of Dhokla family has its own uniqueness which makes it appear and tastes differently than its ascendant Dhokla. Handva, a single layered thick bread is cooked either in pressure cookers or Handva cookers (yes, we have specially designed cookers for it here!) after applying a tadka of oil, mustard, cumin seeds, and curry leaves. Guard, peas, garlic, ginger, green chillies and coriander are the ingredients that make a great combination when served with pickle. We know, the ingredients itself are lip-smacking.</p>
 
<li><h3> Thepla:</li></h3>
<p>Often to be considered as a form of Parathas, however, a little different, Theplas are mostly made of wheat, spices and Green leafy Fenugreek mixed well in dough. They’re much different than the stuffed Parathas popular in the North India. Thepla holds a position among mandatories in food menu while travelling. Served with pickles and various types of Indian curries, it only makes one drool for it!</p>
 
<li><h3> Kadhi:</li></h3>
<p>Yogurt, butter milk, gram flour/maize flour, garlic, ginger, green chillies, black pepper, clove, asafoetida and dry Fenugreek are the ingredients that make this delicious dish. It is often served as a best liquid mixer along with Khichdi, Rice, Chappati or Thepla. Not only that, it sometimes gives pretty much similar effect as the medicines for sore throats when served ready hot.</p>
 
<li><h3> Undhiyu:</li></h3>
<p>Undhiyu, a regional Gujarati dish prepared during the famous kite festival of Gujarat is a very popular dish. An amalgam of different vegetables stuffed with spices and a dry fruit dipped in oil just makes you forget everything and force you to watch the amazing kite competition with Undhiyu to savour.</p>
 
<li><h3> Rotlo:</li></h3>
<p>A common food of many in the state of Gujarat now is becoming an attraction in hotel menus of other states too. Rotlo is bread made of Maize/Millet flour, often taken along with raw white onion, green chillies, Ringan Odeo and butter milk. The combination is surely irrefutable, but Rotlo when combined with jaggery and hot Ghee is totally unbeatable.</p>
 
<li><h3> Matla Undhiyu:</li></h3>
<p>Health conscious people should try this at least once and actually should learn the recipe. MatlaUndhiyu, a member of the Undhiyu family is a delicious dish stuffed with roasted ground nuts, ginger-garlic paste and spices is well cooked in an inverted hot pot. This traditional dish is nothing but a Gujarati Barbeque, only more healthy and appetizing.</p>
 
<li><h3> Sev Tameta nu Shaak:</li></h3>

A typical tomato Indian curry made of tomatoes and onion garnished with green coriander and a Gujarati snack- Sev (deep fried snack made of gram flour). This tempting, delicious dish would burst more hunger cramps in your stomach for sure, so why to wait?</p>
 
<li><h3> Khichdi:</li></h3>
<p>A bowl full of nutritious comfort food made of rice, cereals, vegetables and ghee is what you have for a Gujarati Khichdi. This twice a week cooked food in a Guajarati house is often served with butter milk or Kadhi. After having other deep fried and high calorie food, one should often have Khichdi!</p>

<h3>Farsaan (Snacks):-</h3>
<li><h3> Khandvi:</li></h3>
<p>Khandvi is a popular Gujarati snack among people who love light flavoured dishes rather than spicy food. It is again made from the widely chosen gram flour and curd. You can have it as it is or can be enjoyed with different chutneys made of green chillies or dates. A single piece of Khandvi, dipped in Green chilli-garlic chutney would just make you want to eat more and more!</p>
 
<li><h3> Khakra:</li></h3>
<p>Ask any Guajarati, and they will narrate their love for Khakhras, which are not only tasty but are healthy too. A dry thin crust wheat bread made of cumin seeds, spices and Fenugreek just cannot hold a health conscious person to take a dip into the blessings of both flavour and fitness.</p>
 
<li><h3> Khamman:</li></h3>
<p>A Gujarati snack which is both sweet and spicy has a blend of sugar syrup amalgamated into the fermented gram flour mixture. It’s the best appetizer for the people who have love for both sweet and spicy food. The dual flavour of this dish would surely put you into a world of zests!</p>

<p>A regular companion of tea/milk for any Gujarati is Ganthiya. Often served with famousRajkot ki Meethi Chutney and fried chillies give you a feeling of a never ending pleasure!</p>
 
<li><h3> Locho:</li></h3>
<p>Have you ever asked a Surati about their default love for anything? Ask them, I am sure the answer would be Locho. Yes, that’s correct. A steam boiled street food is a desire of many evening lovers. Served with green chutney and Sev would compel you to relish the moment.</p>
 
<li><h3> Dabeli:</li></h3>
<p>Dabeli, originated from the Kutch region of Gujarat is consumed by people of all ages. A type of Vadapav, stuffed with mashed potato and a mixture of spices and groundnuts is often served with meethi chutney made of Dates and Tamarind. The colourful texture, the aroma of spices and a single bite of Dabeli would surely trigger the flow of Ghrelin in you!</p>
 
<li><h3> Sev Khamni:</li></h3>
<p>This crushed steam boiled food from Surat, Sev Khamni is popular next to Locho. The combination of soft Khamni and the crunchiness of Sev when served with green chutney would ignite the milieu of happy moments in you!</p>
 
<li><h3> Gota:</li></h3>
<p>The crunchy Gota, made of green Fenugreek and gram flour mixture is the street food of Gujarat, very popular in Dakor. It’s quite like the Aloo Vada of Maharashtra, but if you ask us, we say this is way yummier!</p>
