<h2> Dances of West Bengal</h2>
<ul type="disk">
<li><h4>Chhau Dance:</h4></li> 
<p>The Chhau dance of West Bengal is originated from Purulia district. It is included in the sophisticated dance performances of Bengal. The Chhau dance is a mask dance in which only male dancers can participate. In the performance of the Chhau, some of the characteristics of primitive ritualistic dance performance are noted. This can be also seen through its vigour, style and musical accompaniment mainly with the drum. 

In the early period, various shaped symbols were used as facial painting or body painting by dancers. Thus, they are recognized as personifying the characters they are playing in the performance. And later on, the masks appeared in the dance performances. It is said that, the best Chhau dancers are from Baghmundi P.S. Many groups or parties are located from here for the best performance because of their traditional vigorous and heroic style of performance. 

Many other groups like Domordi-group, Birgram-group, Madla-group etc. are also famous for the performance but they are more sophisticated and refined in terms of the themes and dancing styles. The Chorda-group is popular for the best performance is based on the heroic Pauranic themes. Chhau mask dance is predominantly a Bhumij art. 

Basically, it is a festival dance, performed on the occasion of the sun festival observed towards the end of the month of Chaitra as per Bengali Calendar. The festival is celebrated for about one-and-a-half months till before the starting of sowing season. This indicates its linkage with the social and economic life of the Bengal farmer & common man. With passing of time, the situation has changed drastically. Chhau is not only performed on this sun festival but also during many other festivals at other times of year. 

The artistes from rural areas like Midnapur and Purulia districts have kept alive this traditional dance against every heavy odd. So, the dance has its own identity, making it distinctively different from the Chhau dances that are performed in parts of Serai KelIa of Bizarre and Mayurbnanj of Orissa. 

The costumes of the Chhau performers used at the time of its early year performance, over two hundred years ago are not known. But the costumes used in modern period are of various colours and designs. It mainly comprises of pyjamas in deep green or yellow or red shade that is worn by the artistes playing the role of gods, while those, who play the role of demons (asuras) have on loose trousers of a deep black shade. Sometimes, stripes of contrasting colours are used to make the costumes more attractive & different. The costumes for the upper part of the body are full of various designs. A character of Goddess Kali is considered as a popular character in Chhau dance. The costumes for the Kali are made up of cloth of unrelieved black. To express the separate & distinct identity, the characters of animals and birds use suitable type of masks and costumes. 

The masks generally used for Chhau of West Bengal are made in a village called Charida in Baghmundi area of Purulia district. These masks are made up from the clay and paper. The groups of people, who make masks, have been engaged in this business from generations. Generally, these artisans are familiar with the details about the Indian epics so that they bear an ability to produce the high artistic skill. 

The Chhau dance is mythological, as it is mainly based on various episodes of the epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. Sometimes certain episodes of the Puranas are also used. Two rasas are dominant in the performance are Vira and Rudra. At the end, forces of evil are punished and the righteous triumphs. 

No proper dais or raised platform is constructed for its performance. Usually, the dance takes place on the ground where, the spectators can sit in a circle around it. The Chhau dance shows usually start in the night and continues till after daybreak. 

The use of the drum is an important part of Chhau performance. With the beating of drums an invocation to God Ganesha is given and the dance begins. As the singer complete the invocation song, host of drummers and musicians starts beating with the Dhol and the Dhamsa. Dhamsa is a two-faced percussion instrument and gigantic kettledrum played with sticks and fingers respectively. These two traditional musical instruments are used by the rural population in various parts of the country for providing music. 

As it is compulsory for all the characters in the Chhau dance to wear masks, it is impossible for the artistes to show variations in mood through facial expressions. Therefore, various body movements, including movements of the peaks of the masks are used to illustrate different moods. The mask movements show anger, while shoulder and chest movements indicate joy, melancholy and courage etc. Jumping in the air is another movement, which serves as a gesture of attack during the enactment of a war scene. This kind of jumping known as ulfa is a high hallmark of acrobatic skill and physical prowess of the performers of the dance. 

Chhau is considered as the most popular Indian folk dance and said to have originated from some primitive war-hoops. Many experts & scholars feel Chhau had its roots in sympathetic magic, as tribal people performed it in an effort to appease and influence the Sun God. 

Though about its origin there exist confusion, it forms an important part of the rich legacy of the folk culture of West Bengal and still it has gained international popularity. The Purulia-school has got a huge popularity today not only because of its gorgeous masks and dresses, but also for its touching themes and dignified gaits as well.

Gambhira songs are assumed to have originated from the worship of the god Shiva. God Shiva is also known as `Gambhir` so the dance is termed according to that.

At present, the main characters in the Gambhira are a maternal grandfather and his grandson. The performance is usually structured as a dialogue between them, interspersed with songs for fluent flow. Both prose and verse kinds of dialogues are used. The Gambhira reflects contemporary social problems through witty dialogues, songs, dances and jokes. Sometimes it also reflects a generation contradiction in opinions & choices. 

The costumes for this performance are very simple. Both of performers wear lungi. The gray-bearded grandfather wears a mathal i.e.straw hat on his head and holds a stick in his hand. Whereas, the grandson wears a torn jersey and has a gamchha, a local checked towel that is tied round his waist.
