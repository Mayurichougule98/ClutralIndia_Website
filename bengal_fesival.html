<li><h4>Bengali New Year</h4></li>
<p>The Bengali New Year or "Poila Baisakh" (the first day of the month of Baisakh) is celebrated around 15 April on the basis of the lunar calendar of Bangabda. Visitors to homes are greeted with sweets, and trade establishments are decorated with auspicious garlands of marigold and 'aam' leaves. Shop-owners and businessmen offer puja at Dakshineshwar Kali Temple and Kalighat Kali Temple in the morning with new ledgers(Halkhata). Businessmen also offer free sweets as a goodwill gesture on this day. It is celebrated by cultural programmes throughout Kolkata.</p>

<h2>Religious festivals</h2>
<li><h4>Durga Puja pandal</h4></li>

The Durga Puja festival, held in accordance to the lunar calendar of 'Bangabda' in September–October, is the most vibrant time in Kolkata. Durga Puja is the most important, most popular and largest festival of Kolkata. More than 4500 pandals are set up in Kolkata and its suburbs, apart from large number of old family pujas. Kolkata is famous for its vibrant nightlife and glamourous cultural activities during Durga Puja which continue till Kojagori Lakshmi Puja. Durga Puja has become Kolkata's biggest public spectacle, art event and consumerist carnival. Streets, alleys, parks, gardens and most of the neighbourhoods glitter with lighting decorations. Shops, restaurants and eateries stay open all night. Songs and mantras are chanted through loudspeakers. Pandal-visiting with friends, family members and relatives along with other festivities continue late into night. This Hindu religious festival commemorates the mythology of Goddess Durga and her trusty lion steed overpowering and killing the demon Mahishasura (Buffalo-demon). The first ceremony takes place on Mahalaya, the day the Goddess was conceived, and ends on Bijaya Dashami (the victorious tenth day), the day the Goddess finally kills the demon in battle. Puja is performed only on the sixth to the tenth day. Kolkata celebrates Durga Puja with elaborate pandal—temporary decorative scaffolding serving the purpose of a temple—constructions on virtually every street. Crowds of people throng the streets of Kolkata all night; the number is purported to be a few million on the climactic eighth and ninth nights, possibly the second largest annual human conglomerate after the Hajj. On this festival, there is a practice of giving gifts—usually new clothes in the latest fashion in pre-puja get-togethers, and sweets at post-puja get-togethers (Bijaya Sammelani). The festival is commemorated by the publishing of Annuals (Sharadiya or Puja Annual) by most Kolkata magazines and presses.
Today's Puja goes far beyond religion and ritual worship. In fact, visiting the pandals recent years, one can only say that Durga Puja today is the largest outdoor art festival on earth. In the 1990s, a preponderance of architectural models came up on the pandal exteriors, but today the art motif extends to elaborate interiors, executed by trained artists, with consistent stylistic elements, carefully executed and bearing the name of the artist.
At the end of the six days long festival, the idol is taken in a procession of the deity to her home with her husband in the Himalayas. On Vijaya Dashami, the idols are carried out in large processions from all corners of the city to various ghats of the Ganga river. The processions end up with Dhunuchi-naach, dance, maddening revelries and Sindoor-khela after which the idols are immersed into the river amidst frolicking cheers. After this, in a tradition called Vijaya Dashami, families visit each other and sweetmeats are offered to visitors (Dashami is literally tenth day and Vijay is victory).</p>

<li><h4>Kali Puja & Diwali</h4></li>
<p>Kali Puja is primarily a Bengali Hindu festival, held in accordance to the lunar calendar around the first week of November. The Goddess Kali is worshipped at night on one night in thousands of pandals, temples and homes. Animals, especially goats are ritually sacrificed in some places during the puja. Kali Puja is light-up night for Kolkata, corresponding to the North Indian festival of Diwali (pronounced Dipabali in Bengali), where people light candles in memory of the souls of departed ancestors and decorate their homes with lights and rangoli. Most homes celebrate the evening with a wondrous display of candles along roof tops, verandas and window sills; during the afternoon, thousands of beautifully decorated hot-air balloons fill the sky. This is also a night of spectacular fireworks, with local youth burning sparklers and crackers throughout the night. Luminous darting streaks and deafening bangs and booms enlivens the atmosphere. However, Kolkata had to pass legislature a few years back to ban fireworks which break the 65 decibel sound limit, as ambient noise levels were going up to 90 decibels or more in parts of the city.</p>

<li><h4>Saraswati Puja</h4></li>

Saraswati Puja—the puja of the Goddess of Learning, Saraswati—is celebrated with domestic pujas, and familial gatherings in Kolkata. The typical fare (bhog) which accompanies the Puja depends dramatically on whether the family is initially from West Bengal (or ghoti) or from East Bengal—now Bangladesh—(or bangal). Ghotis have vegetarian fare, while bangals partake paired Hilsa fishes. Idols for these and other Pujas are made in the famous potters' district of Kumartuli. In Bengal, during Saraswati Puja, students celebrate the Homecoming of the Goddess of Learning. Books are often worshipped in lieu of the clay image of the Goddess. The puja is especially celebrated in schools and other educational institutes. And gives an opportunity of free-mixing among school children and students.</p>

<li><h4>Holi(Dolyatra)</h4></li>

Dol, corresponding to the North Indian festival of Holi, is celebrated on account of the god Lord Krishna, and is supposedly coincident with the advent of spring. Holi is locally known here as Dolyatra or Basanta Utsab. The celebrations start in the city with the burning of Holika bonfire on the night before Holi. The festival of colour involve throwing and sprinkling powdered colour (aabir), and water colour (jal rang) on others. Unsuspecting passers by are often drenched by coloured water balloons, and celebrations often get rowdy with the men partaking the intoxicating drink of shiddhi (bhang), often laced with the stronger charas. Nowadays, Holi party usually means frolicking dance and various delicacies like sweets, biryani, beverages etc.</p>

<li><h4>Rath Yatra</h4></li>
<p>ISCON Rath Yatra, Kolkata 2015 in Kolkata.
The symbolic movement of the chariot of Jagannath is celebrated with much fanfare in Kolkata due to the huge chariot brought out by ISKCON. The destination of the cult figures are the Maidan. Thousands of people spill into the roads to witness the pulling of the chariot. The "idols" are brought back after a week in the chariot in the festival of Ulto Ratha. Images of Jagannath are set upon the chariots and pulled through the streets by the children as well as by the adults in many neighbourhoods and areas. The week is synonymous with numerous fairs (Rather mela) held all over Kolkata parks, known for their distinctive food and carousels. Myth has it that it always rains on the day of Ratha Yatra in Kolkata. Rath Yatra is an ancient culture in Bengal in spite of having its origin at Puri, Odisha.</p>

<li><h4>Vishwakarma Puja</h4></li>
<p>Vishwakarma Puja is a unique day in Kolkata when all factories, shops, engineering institutes organise puja of Vishwakarma, the Hindu god of mechanics and crafts. It usually includes kite-flying as a celebration.</p>

<li><h4>Janmashtami</h4></li>
<p>Janmashtami in Kolkata is mostly confined to personal and family worship of Lord Krishna. Special puja is held at famous Madanmohan Temple of Baghbazar in North Kolkata and Birla Temple in South Kolkata where devotees celebrate Janmashtami by praying, fasting and listening to devotional songs. Images of infant Lord Krishna are placed in swings and cradles at temples and homes and sweets are offered to the visitors. It is a public holiday in West Bengal.</p>

<li><h4>Jagaddhatri Puja</h4></li>
<p>Unlike Durga and Kali Puja, Jagaddhatri Puja sees much less celebration in the city. However, at Chandannagar in Hooghly district, it is a five-day long puja, with pompous lighting decorations and pandals. Jagaddhatri Puja is important because it brings an end to the month-long festive season that starts with Durga Puja.</p>
